I am mainly interested in Deep Learning and my current research spans several topics, such as Computer vision, NLP and Multimodal learning. During my graduate studies, I focused on Applied Math, Deep Learning and Computer Vision. Previously I did internships in several companies and spent some time in academic labs.
