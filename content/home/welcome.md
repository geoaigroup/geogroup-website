<b>Unlock the full potential of Earth Observation🛰️</b><br>
GEOspatial Artificial Intelligence (GEOAI) is a research group at the Lebanese National Center for Remote Sensing - CNRS. Our research is focused on AI-assisted mapping spanning various applications, including urban analytics, transportation, waterbodies monitoring and crop-yield estimation. We develop tools to automate the process of urban features extraction and crowd-source data collection. Evidence gained from our models allows for a robust humanitarian response and provides policymakers/key-stakeholders with insights to design tailored regulations and safety countermeasures for urban social good.<br> GEOAI group provides a unique opportunity for geospatial training in a professional research environment in Lebanon. <strong>We have hosted more than 60 students at both undergraduate and graduate levels since 2016.<!-- </strong> GEOAI <a href="../media/GEOAI_1Slide.pdf" target=_blank>signle-slide</a> and <a href="../media/GEOAI_portfolio_23May2023.pdf" target=_blank>full-length</a> portfolios are made available.-->
