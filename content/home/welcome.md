<b>Unlock the full potential of Earth Observationüõ∞Ô∏è</b><br>
GEOspatial Artificial Intelligence (GEOAI) is a research group at the Lebanese National Center for Remote Sensing - CNRS. Our research is focused on geomatics
and AI-assisted mapping spanning various applications, including urban analytics, transportation, waterbodies monitoring and crop-yield estimation. We develop tools to automate the process of urban features extraction and crowd-source data collection. Evidence gained from our models allows for a robust humanitarian response and provides policymakers/key-stakeholders with insights to design tailored regulations and safety countermeasures for urban social good.<br> GEOAI group provides a unique opportunity for geospatial training in a professional research environment in Lebanon. <strong>We have hosted more than 60 students at both undergraduate and graduate levels since 2016.
