Geospatial Earth Observation (GEO) is a research group located at the <a href="http://rsensing.cnrs.edu.lb" target="_blank">National Center for Remote Sensing </a> - <a href="http://www.cnrs.edu.lb" target="_blank">CNRS Lebanon</a>. GEO harnessess the power of artificial intelligence to unlock the potential of satellite data by focusing on AI-assisted mapping spanning various applications, including geospatial Earth observation, urban analytics, transportation, and features extraction from aerial imagery. We develop tools integrating deep learning techniques to automate the process of urban features extraction and collect crowd-sourcing data from various sources. 

Evidence gained from our models and data analysis allows for a robust humanitarian response and provides policymakers and key stakeholders with insights to design tailored regulations and safety countermeasures for urban social good.
